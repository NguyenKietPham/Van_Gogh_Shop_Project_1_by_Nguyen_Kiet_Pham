        <h2>Who is Van Gogh?</h2>
        <p>
          <mark>Vincent van Gogh</mark> was a Dutch Post-Impressionist artist whose work transformed the history of modern art through its emotional depth, vivid color, and expressive brushwork. Born on March 30, 1853, in Zundert, Netherlands,<mark> Van Gogh‚Äôs life was marked by passion, creativity, and hardship.</mark> Before becoming a painter, he worked in various professions, including art dealing and ministry, but it was his decision to dedicate himself to art in his late twenties that defined his legacy. Despite producing over 2,000 artworks around 900 paintings and 1,100 drawings he sold only a few pieces during his lifetime and lived in poverty, supported largely by his brother Theo.
        <br><br>Throughout his life, Van Gogh faced severe mental health challenges. His well-known episode of cutting off part of his ear and his stays in psychiatric hospitals revealed his inner turmoil. Yet, even during those difficult times, he continued to paint with extraordinary energy and emotion. <mark>Tragically, Van Gogh died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1890 at the age of 37.</mark> Though his life was short and troubled, his artistic vision left a lasting impact on the world. <mark>Today, his works are celebrated for their honesty, color, and powerful expression of the human soul, inspiring countless artists and admirers across generations.</mark>

        <h2>Masterpieces</h2>
        <p>
          Van Gogh‚Äôs style evolved rapidly over the years. Early works such as <mark>The Potato Eaters</mark> (1885) were dark and somber, reflecting the struggles of rural laborers. However, after moving to France, he began experimenting with brighter colors and looser brushstrokes influenced by Impressionism and Japanese prints. His time in Arles, in the south of France, became one of his most productive periods. There, he painted masterpieces such as <mark>Sunflowers, Caf√© Terrace at Night, and Bedroom in Arles,</mark> capturing scenes filled with light, warmth, and emotional intensity.
